# Python errors 2
# Find the errors. The comment at the start says what the code should do. What is wrong with the code examples below? Try them out and get them working as they should. Note that some of these examples have more than one error.
# There are three types of errors: Syntax errors (which can be detected before the code is run and can prevent the program from running at all), Run-time errors (which only become apparent when we run the code), and Logic errors (which cause the program to not perform as expected). Can you also categorise the errors into one of these types? 
# Example 1
# 1 This outputs hello world to the screen
print ('Hello world ') #syntax

# Example 2
# 2 This prints on the screen the addition of 12 and 19
print (12 + 19) #logic

# Example 3
# 3 This asks for your name and prints on the screen Howdy followed by your name
yourname = input('What is your name? ')
print ('Howdy ' + yourname) #Syntax

# Example 4
# 4 This adds the two integers together and prints the answer 
n1 = int(input('Enter the first integer. '))
n2 = int(input('Enter the second integer. '))
print (n1 + n2) #runtime

# Example 5
# 5 Converts meters entered to cm, km, inches, and prints the answers 
meters = eval(input("Enter Meters " ))
cm = meters * 100
km = meters / 1000
inches = meters * 39.37
print(str(meters) + " meters  = " + str(cm) + "cm, " + str(km) + "km," + str(inches) + "inches" ) #syntax

# Example 6
# 6 This asks for two numbers and then multiplies them together and prints the answer
numb1 = float(input("Enter number 1 "))
numb2 = float(input("Enter number 2 "))
print(numb1 * numb2) #syntax

# Example 7
# 7 This defines two numbers, divides them and prints the answer
numb1 = 234
numb2 = 123
print (numb1 / numb2) #runtime

# Example 8
# 8 This outputs all the numbers from 1 to 12
for i in range (1, 13):
    print(i) #syntax
    
# Example 9
# 9 This outputs all the numbers from 1 to 12
i = 1
while (i < 13):
    print(i)
    i = i + 1 #syntax

# Example 10
# 10 This adds up all the numbers from 1 to 7 outputting the calculation then the answer
endValue = 7
total = 0
for i in range (1, endValue):
    total = total + i
    print(i, "+ ", end = '')

print (" =", total) #logic

# Example 11
# 11 Program to show a for loop counting to an entered value
endValue = int(input ("Enter the end number (between 5 and 12) "))
if 5 < endValue <= 12:
    for i in range (1, 1 + endValue):
        print(i)
else:
  print("Entered Value Not in Range") #syntax
    
# Example 12
# 12 This adds up all the numbers in a list/array showing the calculation
numbers = [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, -2, -1]
total = 0
for i in numbers:
    if total == 0:
        print(i, end='x')
        total = i
    else:
        total = total + i
        print(" +", i, end='')

print(" =", total) #runtime
