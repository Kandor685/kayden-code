# Python errors
# Find the errors. The comment at the start says what the code should do. What is wrong with the code examples below? Try them out and get them working as they should. Note that some of these examples have more than one error.
# There are three types of errors: Syntax errors, Run-time errors, and Logic errors. Can you also categorise the errors into one of these types? 
# Example 1
# #This asks for your name and prints hello there <your name>
yourname = input('What is your name? ')
print ('Hello there ' + yourname) 

# Example 2
#This adds the two numbers together and prints the answer 
n1 = float(input('Enter the first number. '))
n2 = float(input('Enter the second number. '))
print (n1 + n2) 

# Example 3
#Converts meters entered to cm, km, inches, and prints the answers 
meters = float(input("Enter Meters "))
cm = meters * 100
km = meters / 1000
inches = meters * 39.37
print(str(meters) + " meters  = " + str(cm) + "cm, " + str(km) + "km") 

# Example 4
#This multiplies the two numbers together and prints the answer
numb1 = float(input("Enter number 1 "))
numb2 = float(input("Enter number 2 "))
print(numb1 * numb2) 

# Example 5
#'This defines two numbers, divides them and prints the answer
numb1 = 234
numb2 = 12
print (numb1 / numb2)

# Example 6
# Python Program to show a for loop counting to an entered value
endValue = int(input ("Enter the end number (between 5 and 12) "))
if 5 < endValue <= 12:
    for i in range (1, 1 + endValue):
        print(i)
else:
  print("Entered Value Not in Range")
print("The end")
